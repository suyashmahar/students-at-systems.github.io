        contents: I only chat with folks where i think they could be a viable part of my group, and the chat helps me see if there is a match between us. So it's not like a technical interview and more of a getting to know you kind of interview.

        contents: I also do a short chat w/ students who are viable matches. Usually e-mail them a short, accessible paper to read before the interview, and then ask what they learned from it & talk about ideas that emerge from reading it. Also ask about their goals and expectations.

        contents: Not looking for "right" answers, but whether they can start to formulate ideas (even if the ideas aren't great or have already been done), and can communicate w/ me about research-related concepts. And to get a sense of what they're looking for & how the Ph.D will help them.

        contents: That depends, based on my experience these interviews were mainly casual research conversations (to make sure there is a good match). In very few cases I was given technical problems (no coding), I think this usually happens when the meeting is scheduled for over 30min.

        contents: Agree with @vj_chidambaram; talk to different students in the research group and understand the work culture ... Figure out for yourself if the work culture is agreeable and you see being comfortable doing that for 5-6 years

        contents: The undergrad me was too fixated on university rankings. While things worked out fortunately, I recommend grad applicants to prioritize choosing a supportive advisor, exciting research area, open department culture, and nice location when considering similar tier schools.

        contents: To add onto this, "tiers" matter a lot more than "rankings". There is a big diff between the top-5 and the top-10/top-15, not much difference between rank 14 and 17.

        contents: For example, UT (where I work) and Wisconsin (where i did my PhD) are in the same tier (roughly). The ranks might be different but not in a significant way.

        contents: Adding to the points above, you may get an admit in a department of your choice but not necessarily with a faculty of your choice ... Students often accept admits, hoping they can work with the faculty in the future, but end up disappointed ... Be wary of this

        contents: Similar to point on university rankings ... Don't simply go for the famous, accomplished faculty (the big name) ... pay more attention to whether their work style, research ideas, goals, thought process etc. appeal to you; you'll have a much better PhD experience then

        contents: The most important barriers to grad school that I’ve heard are not knowing 1. Grad school is paid for and you get a small stipend! You do not have to pay for a PhD; and 2. You can get fee waivers from American schools. The way to apply varies. Ask grad students for help.
