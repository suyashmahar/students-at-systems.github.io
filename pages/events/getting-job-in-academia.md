## Getting a job in academia

Panel on getting a job in academia.

We are organizing a panel with senior students in the area of Computer Systems
to talk about their experience on getting an academic jobs. The panel will
specifically focus on students who are planning to get an academic jobs.

The panel will be a one-hour live session with pre-sourced questions and live
discussion. All students interested in getting an academic jobs in CS fields are
invited to join and ask questions!
