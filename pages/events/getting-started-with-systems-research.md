## Getting started with systems research
Panel on getting started with research

We are organizing a panel with senior students in the area of Computer Systems
to talk about their experience as systems researchers. The panel will
specifically focus on students who are getting started in the field of CS
research. 

We will answer questions from broad areas including:

1. How to get started with research in systems as an undergraduate or a young PhD student?
2. Managing your relationship and expectations with your adviser, mentor and peers?
3. What to expect during your PhD?
4. How to get from starting a project to a publication?

The panel will be a one-hour live session with pre-sourced questions and live
discussion. All students interested in the area of systems research or related
CS fields are invited to join and ask questions!

<a target=_blank href="https://www.stewartgrant.ca/">Stewart Grant | PhD student, UC San Diego</a><br>

Stewart is a 4th Year PhD student working in the systems and networking group
with Alex Snoeren at UCSD. His work is focused on sharing and isolation in the
context of SmartNICs and disaggregated memory. You can most likely find him
benchmarking RDMA and DPDK code on the third floor. Within the department he has
assisted as lead on the faculty candidate student panel, and mentored
undergraduates through the ERSP program.  Extraciricurly Stewart is usually rock
climbing or running. Quote - "Let's Bail".

<a target=_blank href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eruppel/">Emily Ruppel | PhD Student, CMU</a><br>

Emily Ruppel is a final-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University advised
by Brandon Lucia. She researches and builds batteryless, energy harvesting
systems that perform perform computationally intensive tasks despite frequent
power failures. Her recent work examines runtime software and programming models
that allow batteryless devices to correctly interact with their physical
environment. She is currently serving as co-chair of the Computer Architecture
Long-term Mentoring (CALM) committee.

<a target=_blank href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jzhou41/">Jie Zhou | Phd Student, University of Rochester</a><br>

Jie Zhou is a final-year PhD student at the University of Rochester. He works on software and systems security, with a focus on memory safety. Currently he is most interested in the interactions between safe and unsafe systems programming languages, and his long-term vision is to gradually push more provably-secure code into software systems. He is now a committee member of the Students@Systems.

<img class="headshot" src="{{ 'assets/img/committee-membs/sliu.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Sihang Liu's Potrait"/>

<a target=_blank href="https://www.sihangliu.com/">Sihang Liu | PhD, University of Virginia</a><br>

Sihang Liu is a final-year Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, working with Prof. Samira Khan. His research interest lies in computer systems and architecture. In particular, he is interested in software-hardware co-design for persistent memory, to make persistent memory systems robust, efficient, and secured. He is also broadly interested in other new and emerging systems, such as near-data processing and in-network processing. His research has been recognized as MICRO Top Picks Honorable Mention, and he is awarded the Google Fellowship. He has broadly participated in mentoring, from research mentoring for high school, undergraduate, and master’s students, and non-technical mentorship, including fellowship application, job hunting, and graduate school application. Currently, he is the co-chair of computer architecture long-term mentorship (CALM) program and a committee member of Students@Systems.
